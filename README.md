### Design Decisions

**Feature-Based Architecture**: We organized code by features rather than file types to improve maintainability and team collaboration. Each feature contains its own components, hooks, and pages.

**Client-Side Data Persistence**: Used Dexie (IndexedDB) instead of a traditional backend to create a fully functional demo without server dependencies. This allows for immediate user interaction while maintaining data across sessions.

**@dnd-kit for Drag & Drop**: Chosen for its accessibility features, TypeScript support, and modern approach to drag-and-drop interactions. Provides smooth animations and proper keyboard navigation.

**Zustand for State Management**: Selected over Redux for its simplicity and minimal boilerplate while still providing powerful state management capabilities.

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Drag & Drop Cursor Alignment
**Issue**: Cursor misalignment during drag operations, particularly when the page is scrolled.

**Root Cause**: Browser viewport calculations in @dnd-kit can be inconsistent when scroll position changes.

**Current Solution**: Implemented whole-card draggable areas instead of small drag handles to improve user experience despite cursor offset.

**Attempted Solutions**:
- Scroll position preservation during drag operations
- Custom DragOverlay positioning
- Various measuring strategies and modifiers

### Performance Considerations
**Virtualization**: Implemented `react-window` for large candidate lists to maintain smooth scrolling performance.

**Optimistic Updates**: Used optimistic state updates for drag operations to provide immediate feedback before API confirmation.
